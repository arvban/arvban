## Hi, I'm Arvid

I'm a bilingual (English/German) computer scientist passionate about solving problems in natural sciences, particularly biology, using mathematical, computational, and practical approaches. I hold a BSc in EECS from ETH ZÃ¼rich and am currently pursuing my MSc in Computer Science, specializing in machine learning with a minor in data management.

## Academic Interests
- Machine learning applications in biology
- Data management in scientific research
- Collaborative problem solving

## Personal
Outside of academics, I enjoy sports, playing the guitar, and experimenting with musical gear like guitars, speakers, and synthesizers. I used to compete in tennis tournaments and now play for a local team in the Swiss Club League.
